I'm doing a Go training on January 10th 9:30am to 4pm. 
Here is roughly what I'm planning to cover.

This is a project driven hands on training, so we will be building a project to learn different Go concepts.

**Project: a [Key Value Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database) like [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd)/[consul](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/getting-started/kv.html) and a CLI (using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)) to interact with it.**

## Prerequisite

- Should've programmed in some language at some point in your life
- [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Install any Go editor. I recommend [Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Go plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Go)
- Run [hello world in Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbW0oQq5NLQ)
- You or a family member must not own a Toyota Prius! (Very important!!)
- If you have a problem with any of these please contact me (Gunjan Patel on slack)
